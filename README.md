# UBER-STOCK-TREND-ANALYSIS-DASHBOARD
**TIME PERIOD** – ```July 2021``` <br/>
<br/>
**Audience** - ```Ulendo Zambia ``` <br/>
<br/>
**Goal** - ```To track Uber Stock Performance in 2020```.<br/>
<br/>
**Context** – Ulendo is a mobility service provider similar to Uber, operating in Zambia. The company requested an overview of Uber stock price movements over a period of one year, 2020. The Uber Stock Trend Analysis dashboard did just that, I used a candlestick chart to enable them to see day by day movements and a dual axis bar and line graph for monthly movements. The line graph gives the percentage changes between the open and close prices, while the adjusted closing price and sales volume. The candlestick chart acts as a filter for all three graphs enabling both daily and monthly tracking for optimum use. <br/>
